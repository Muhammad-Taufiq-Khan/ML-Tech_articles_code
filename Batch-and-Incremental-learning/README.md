File description:
- multiflow                   : The virtal environment, conaining all the required dependencies to run the notebooks. You will need to activate the environment. Also, change the notebook kernal and python interpreter to the virtual environment's kernal and interpreter.
- Batch_Learning.ipynb        : Jupyter notebook for Batch Learning/Offline Learning implementaion.
- Incremental_Learning.ipynb  : Jupyter notebook for Incremental Learning/Online Learning implementaion.
- elec.csv                    : The dataset.
- requirements.txt            : List of required dependencies. You can download the required dependencies in your machine by using $pip install requirements.txt command.
